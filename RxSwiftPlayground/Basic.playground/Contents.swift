/// MARK - Observables

/*
 Observable sequence is just a sequence. Compared with Swift's Sequence, Observable can receive elements asynchronously.
 - Obserable is equivalent to Sequence.
 - Observable.subscribe method is equivalent to Sequence.makeIterator method.
 
 When a sequence sends "completed" or "error" event, all internal resources that compute sequence elements will be free.
 To cancel production of sequence emmediately immediately, call dispose on the returned subscription.
